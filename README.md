# Issue/PR Templates and Reuseable Workflows

This repository contains 2 reuseable subjects:

## 1. Issue/PR Templates
These are templates for issues and pull requests, which will get applied to all repositories organization-wide automatically. They are stored in the `.github` directory in the root of the repository.

Read more about how and why we use them on Confluence here: https://leancoders.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/LEANCODERS/pages/2664267791/GitHub+Issue+PR+Templates

Please note that they should help us adhere to conventional commit syntax. Read more about that on Confluence or the official docs: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary

## 2. Reuseable Workflows

These are GitHub Actions workflows that can be copied and pasted into any repository to automate common tasks. They are stored in the `reuseable-workflows` directory in the root of the repository.

Each workflow has its own README file that explains how to set it up and what it does. The README files are stored in the same directory as the workflow files, with a `.md` extension instead of `.yml`.

## Contributing
The templates that were added are likely not perfect and look to be iterated on. If you have any suggestions, please open a pull request!
