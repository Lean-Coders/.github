# Issue + PR Templates

This repository contains the templates for issues and pull requests, which will get applied to all repositories organization-wide.

Read more about how and why we use them on Confluence here: **TODO: ADD WHEN DOCS ARE FINISHED**

Especially note that they should help us adhere to conventional commit syntax. Read more about that on Confluence or the official docs: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary

## Contributing
The templates that were added are likely not perfect and look to be iterated on. If you have any suggestions, please open a pull request!
